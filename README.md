# SDF

### Hi. This is my first independent project, which was started as a graduation project in the Beetroot academy. I am currently continuing to work on this project.

### What is it: It's a web-based project management application, similar in concept to Trello, Jira, and so on.
### What I use for realization: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, HTML & CSS, Bootstrap, HTMX, JavaScript.

### What was implemented: home page, registration and authorization with email and password validation, profile editing and password change page, home page with small analytics about user projects, project list page (plus creating a new project, editing or deleting existing ones), task board page.
